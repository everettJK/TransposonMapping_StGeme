This analysis describes the creation of a sequencing library created from *Kingella kingae* DNA samples provided 
by the St. Geme research group and the subsequent mapping of identified transpon insertions. A sequencing library 
was created by shearing genomic DNA and the attachment of adapter sequences followed by a nested PCR 
where the first set of primers bound within the body of the experimental transposon while the second set 
of primers bound within the transposon ITR segments. The library was sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq 
platform and transposon insertions were identified by searching for the 8 terminal ITR nucleotides followed 
by a TA sequence (CAACCTGTTA). The number of insertions recovered from each sample is shown in Table 1. 
Sequences were aligned to the representative *Kingella kingae* strain *Vir5453* (NCBI tax id: 1305785).

For the purpose of visualizing the data, the number of recovered insertions were normalized by dividing the 
number of sites within 10KB genomic blocks by the total number of sites recovered in each sample (Figure 1).

The number of insertions within transcription units (TUs) was gauged using two approaches. The first 
approach considered the number of insertions within each TU divided by the total number of insertions 
recovered in the sample. The second approach considered the total number of inferred cells 
(unique genomic break points) associated with insertions within each TU divided by the total number 
of inferred cells in the sample. The site count approach showed a fair degree of variation between techinical 
replicates (Figure 2) while the abundance method showed less variation between replicates and averaged samples (Figure 3).

Using the abundance approach, clear clustering of biological samples was found though there was not remarkable separation 
between control and challenge samples whithin biological sample clusters (Figures 4 & 5). The normalized site count 
approach provided less distinctive clustering (Supp. Figures S1 & S2).

For each transcription unit, t-tests were used to test for differences between control and challenge insertion frequencies. 
Transcription units with significant uncorrected p-values are shown in Tables 2 & 3. Full gene tables 
are available on-line via this [**link**](https://github.com/everettJK/TransposonMapping_StGeme).
